Coding Test for WeUsThem

Description#

I developed through Java Android Studio, and server at Firebase, Google.
I have done Login and Registration due to each user has their own contacts.

The user can registrate and Login, if they login successful, the user can add a contact with first name, last name, email, and phone number, and the information of contact is added onto firebase of the user. 
The user can see their own contacts with first name, last name, Email, and phone number after login successfully. I have tried to add each images for each contacts, but I could not done it due to time limit.
However, I found how to add images on firebase storage, I successfully upload a image which from an album. Only I need to complete this part, getting a image from storage and connecto to a user who has image's own id.

I have used Recycler View to show list of contacts, and I was going to add function that updating a contact's information if I click a profile of a member.
Unfortunately, I could not done the part yet, but if I refer to a project which I previously done, I can complete that part.

I know how to upgrade a profile of RecyclerView, but I was not able to complete that part due to time.
